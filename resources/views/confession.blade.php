                Our church holds to the Westminster Confession of Faith, as a
                subordinate standard to the Word of God.

                    The Westminster Confession of Faith was created by the Westminster
                    Assembly in 1646, with commissioners from both England and Scotland.
                    The Confession of Faith was adapted by General Assembly of the Church
                    of Scotland in 1647, and continues to be the Confession of Faith for
                    many reformed Presbyterian denominations throughout the world.
